#### Modified form of Ania Kubow candy crash game

Fistly this game is developed by Ania Kubow, thanks to her, bzc her game gave me the idea how to make it fully functional, responsive & user-friendly. So I added a lot of features like game levels, touch events , checking the user progress every time etc...
